<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Reburning NOx Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fuel reburning NOx control systems encompass two primary technologies: Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). SNCR utilizes a urea or ammonia injection process at high temperatures to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions without a catalyst, making it simpler and less costly. In contrast, SCR employs a catalyst to enhance the reaction efficiency at lower temperatures, leading to more effective NOx reduction. Both technologies are vital for industrial plants aiming to meet stringent environmental regulations while minimizing operational costs.</p></p>

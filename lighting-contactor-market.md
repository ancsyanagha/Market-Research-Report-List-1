<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lighting Contactor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrically Held</li><li>Mechanically Held</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lighting contactor market can be divided into two main types: electrically held and mechanically held contactors. Electrically held contactors use an electromagnetic coil to maintain the contact position when power is applied, ensuring quick and reliable operation. They are commonly used in automated systems. Conversely, mechanically held contactors utilize mechanical latching mechanisms, providing a more stable position without continuous power, making them ideal for energy-saving applications. Both types serve critical roles in controlling lighting in various environments.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-ventricular Extracorporeal Life Support Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA</li><li>VV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-ventricular extracorporeal life support (ECLS) devices primarily serve two types: Veno-Arterial (VA) and Veno-Venous (VV) support. VA ECLS circulates blood from the venous system to the arterial system, providing cardiac and respiratory support, often used in cases of cardiac failure. In contrast, VV ECLS facilitates respiratory support by oxygenating blood directly from the venous return and delivering it back into the venous system, mainly aiding patients with severe respiratory failure while preserving heart function.</p></p>
